MODEL TRAINING SUMMARY
============================================================

Dataset:
  • Total Employees: 1470
  • Features Used: 25
  • Training Samples: 1176
  • Test Samples: 294

Model Performance:
  • Accuracy: 72.4%
  • Precision: 33.7%
  • Recall: 74.5%
  • F1-Score: 46.4%
  • ROC-AUC: 0.801

Key Insights:
  • Model can identify 74% of employees who will leave
  • 34% accuracy when predicting 'at risk' employees
  • Good balance between catching attrition and avoiding false alarms

Next Steps:
  1. Analyze feature importance (which factors drive attrition most?)
  2. Identify high-risk employees for retention intervention
  3. Create automated risk scoring system
